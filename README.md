This repository corresponds to the implementation of DDPG to optimize the parameters of vehicle production shop. Firstly, feature selection of a large number of sensor features in the spray shop is carried out. Then, LSTM is used to forecast emissions of two kinds of pollutants from the workshop. Thirdly, we use DDPG to optimize manufacturing parameters.

The structure of this repository is as follows:

1. notebook folder contains .ipynb file to realize the above functions.
2. .py files are reference files for implementing related functions.
